# WildMath - The Numbers Strike Back üèπüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è

## Inspiration

WildMath was born from the idea that learning math shouldn‚Äôt feel intimidating, it should feel like play.
 While exploring various educational platforms, we realized that many were either too static or lacked visual appeal, making the learning experience feel tedious for students.
 We wanted to reimagine math as something exciting, intuitive, and beautifully designed a tool for sparking curiosity, not anxiety.
That‚Äôs how WildMath came to life: an interactive, visually polished math platform built to engage learners of all levels.

## What it does

WildMath is a web-based RPG game where players embark on a fantasy quest filled with math challenges. Players select a character class (Knight, Wizard, Archer), travel through magical realms like Fraction Forest or Geometry Gorge, and solve math problems to cast spells, defend against enemies, and unlock new areas. The game dynamically adjusts difficulty based on the player‚Äôs performance, making it suitable for different learning levels. Players can track progress, earn rewards, and develop confidence in math through engaging gameplay.

## How we built it

We built WildMath using **React** for the frontend and styled it with **Tailwind CSS** to create a clean, responsive interface. The project structure was modular, allowing for component reusability and scalability. Animations were added using **Framer Motion**, and routing was handled through **React Router**. The development process involved designing in **Figma**, iterating through prototypes, and hosting the final product on **Vercel**. We prioritized accessibility and responsiveness to ensure the platform works smoothly across devices.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the major challenges was balancing educational content with game mechanics in a way that felt natural. We wanted math problems to be core to gameplay without feeling forced or disruptive. Designing adaptive difficulty required careful consideration to avoid frustrating or boring users. Ensuring smooth performance with rich visuals and animations was another hurdle, especially when optimizing for mobile devices.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We‚Äôre proud of building a complete, playable RPG experience with educational value in a short timeframe. The feedback we received from users about how fun and intuitive the game felt was incredibly rewarding. We successfully integrated math topics with game logic and built a fantasy world that supports engagement and learning.

## What we learned

This project helped us strengthen our skills in frontend development, particularly with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. We learned how to design for accessibility, how to manage state effectively using React hooks, and how to build animations that enhance user experience without overwhelming the interface. We also gained experience in structuring scalable applications and incorporating user feedback quickly.

## What's next for WildMath

We plan to add more kingdoms and math topics, including probability, ratios, and algebraic expressions. We're also exploring multiplayer modes where students can collaborate or compete in math challenges. A backend integration with user accounts and progress saving is also on our roadmap. Additionally, we aim to incorporate AI for personalized learning paths and voice interactions to make math even more accessible and enjoyable.
